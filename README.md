The objective of this assignment was to create a database that could be updated and accessed online.
Overall, these step by step direction of this tutorial was pretty easy going. The challenges I had faced while working on this task was was primarily remembering and getting use to all the new concepts that were introduced to me while working on this tutorial. This would include getting use to the pug views and the updating of the controller models. With the step by step direction and having to repeat the process on mutiple different views, I ended up finding myself having to read the tutorial mutiple times, especially when tackling the programming challenges, so I could fully understand and refresh myself on everything that was needing changed.

In reflection, I enjoyed the project quite a bit and I can forsee it being usful whenever a project in need of a database comes up. Also, experimenting with pug and the ORM approach in gregards to databasing was a unique experience that I'm sure will impact how I tackle future projects.
